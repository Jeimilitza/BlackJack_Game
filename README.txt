This project is an interactive C++ program that simulates a friendly game of Blackjack, adhering to the rules outlined in Wikipedia. The program utilizes object-oriented programming principles, including classes and functions, as well as arrays and various other C++ commands. 

Upon launching the program, it prompts the user to initiate a game and subsequently manages the card drawing process. The game's progression strictly follows the established Blackjack rules. Once the game concludes, the program invites the user to opt for another round if they wish to continue playing.

One notable feature of this implementation is the inclusion of a Joker card, which can function as a Wild Card with a value up to the highest-ranked card in the deck needed to complete the player's hand. In cases where such a card is not required, the player is given the autonomy to determine its value for their specific hand, whether it belongs to the user or the program.

This game will persistently run as long as the user desires, allowing for multiple rounds of enjoyable gameplay.
